      <dl>
        <dt>Why was this made?</dt>
        <dd>
          We really enjoyed using Weave.in during it's time and met a couple of great folks.
          We want to bring back the joy of meeting like-minded individuals every week.
        </dd>
        <dt>Who is this for?</dt>
        <dd>
          If you're looking to meet and connect with new people, this is for you.
          Whether that's for hiring, to meet a cofounder, to help others or expand your network, this is
          made for that.
        </dd>
        <dt>How does this work?</dt>
        <dd>
          At the start of the week, you will receive an Email asking you to confirm meetings for that week.
          Later on, we will match and send introductions to other individuals in the community to your inbox - look out for them!
        </dd>
        <dt>Why do I need to be approved?</dt>
        <dd>
          We can't be everywhere at all times!
          We want to make sure there is enough users in each city before launching and matching people.
          Lastly, we want to make sure everyone is serious and committed to the community.
